Threadline is an RSS reader, built as an Electron app, using the Svelte front-end, and a SQLITE back-end. The system is single-user. The app has a basic toolbar along the left side of the app with font-awesome button icons, a resizeable left sidebar that the list of feeds, a panel to the right of the sidebar that lists entries in the currently selected feed, and the right "content" area for displaying the content of the currently selected post within the feed. The toolbar has buttons to add, remove, and edit feeds. Create an implementation plan as a starting point, save the implementation plan, including assumptions, scope, and major implementation steps to /docs/plan/plan-implementation.md. List the major phases of the plan, and I will review and approve.
